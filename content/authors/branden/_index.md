Branden DuPont is a data analyst at the Medical College of Wisconsin. His work revolves around using analytics to address social problems with a focus on criminal and civil justice policy. Current and completed projects include building a statewide database of Wisconsin Criminal Cases, applying NLP methods to analyze sentencing, and developing a method to evaluate statewide recidivism. He also built out a project tracking evictions in the City of Milwaukee which has been featured by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Next City, and the Sunlight Foundation. You can view the project [here.](https://mke-evict.com/)


He resides in Riverwest, Milwaukee and more often than not bikes to work - even during the harsh and unforgiving Wisconsin winters.
