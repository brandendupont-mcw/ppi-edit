Dr. Webster joined the Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology in the Fall of 2018. She is a former communications professional at the Innocence Project, and an alum of the Rutgers School of Criminal Justice. She studies criminal justice system errors and the processes, policies, and perceptions that contribute to, and remedy, these errors. Her research, “A Postconviction Mentality: Prosecutorial Assistance as a Pathway to Exoneration,” which explores prosecutors’ decision making in wrongful conviction cases, was funded by the National Institute of Justice. Her current research projects include prosecutor-community relationships, attorneys’ use of religious rhetoric, and administrative errors of justice.
