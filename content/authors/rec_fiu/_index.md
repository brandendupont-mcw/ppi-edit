Her post-doc position at the Center for the Administration of Justice centers on the Data-Informed Prosecution Project devoted to helping State Attorney’s Offices become more effective and fair through the improvement of data and analytical capacity. Dr. Richardson is also working with Dr. Brian Johnson (University of Maryland) and the State of Connecticut on a two-year project evaluating the potential impacts of evidence-based sentencing on punishment decisions and social inequality.
