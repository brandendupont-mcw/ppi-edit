Dr. Meldrum’s research interests are broadly focused on the causes of juvenile and young adult offending. His research has appeared in such journals as Criminology, Justice Quarterly, Journal of Quantitative Criminology, Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency, Developmental Psychology, Criminal Justice and Behavior, Journal of Criminal Justice, Crime & Delinquency, Sleep Health, Intelligence, and Journal of Youth and Adolescence, among others. He is the winner of the 2016 Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences New Scholar Award, was named a 2016 FIU Top Scholar for Research, and was named a 2019 FIU Top Scholar for Student Mentorship.

Dr. Meldrum's teaching interests focus primarily on Research Methods and Criminological Theory. In addition, he developed a Biosocial Criminology, which utilizes Kevin Beaver's Biosocial Criminology textbook, along with Adrian Raine's The Anatomy of Violence, to teach students about cutting edge cross-disciplinary theory and research on the neural, genetic, and biological underpinnings of antisocial behavior and how these factors intersect with social factors emphasized by mainstream criminological theories.
