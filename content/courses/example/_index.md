This guide will give an overview on how to deploy prosecutorial performance indicators in your office. It is organized in three parts: planning, testing, and application. Before reviewing the guide, below are several high level considerations.

## Why PPIs?
> Prosecutorial performance has been traditionally measured by conviction
rates and sentence length. Yet, public demand for greater accountability
and impartiality also requires a focus on community well-being and
fairness. PPIs help meet these demands by offering an array of metrics that
can be tracked over time to inform decision making and policy
development.

## What PPIs measure
> PPIs measure inputs, outputs, activities, and impacts of prosecutorial
offices. They include timeliness of decision making, case prioritization,
diversity of prosecutors, violent recidivism, participation in community
events, frequency of contact with victims, diversion success rates, racial
disparities in plea offers, accuracy in charging, and conviction integrity
reviews.

## What PPIs don’t measure
PPIs are not designed to measure individual prosecutor performance.
Instead, they measure unit-level and office-wide performance over time.
They also do not measure public opinion. While important, most offices do
not have the ability to regularly survey the public about their performance.

## How PPIs are organized
Indicators are organized within nine topics. These topics form three
themes: Capacity & Efficiency, Community Safety & Well-Being, and
Fairness and Justice.

## Choosing PPIs for your office
Not every office has the capacity or desire to use each of the PPIs. Offices
can select and modify PPIs to meet their needs, community interests, and
data requirements. However, we strongly encourage offices to adopt at
least three PPIs from each of the nine topics.

## What data sources PPIs use
Case management systems are the primary source of data for the PPIs.
Other data sources may include the clerk of the court, the sheriff’s office,
and human resources staff within prosecutor’s offices. Because an office’s
current capacity is unlikely to permit data collection for all desired PPIs,
each office should discuss what additional data to collect and how to do so
with minimal resource expenditure.

## How frequently to collect data for PPIs
PPIs are measured either monthly, quarterly, or annually. PPIs about
dynamic office activities, such as average caseloads, are measured
monthly. Other PPIs that capture events occurring less frequently, such as
case reversals, are measured quarterly. Still other PPIs, such as staff
diversity, are measured annually because they are not expected to change
monthly or quarterly.

## How the PPIs were developed
PPIs were developed through discussions with district and state attorneys,
consultation with experts on prosecution and performance measurement,
interviews with over 75 line prosecutors, field testing in four offices, review
of existing criminal justice indicator tools, and our own experience
developing indicators.
