- Introduce and explain the PPI framework office-wide. 
- With help from data ambassadors, foster an office culture of data use. 
- Develop a roll-out strategy that is time-bound and explicit about staff roles and responsibilities during implementation. 
- Manage your expectations about buy-in among staff but be persistent about garnering support for the initiative.
