 - Hold meetings with staff and partners for the explicit purpose of discussing PPIs and potential impact for their work.

- Examine the current clerical/IT/analytical capacity for entering, extracting, linking, managing, and analyzing data. 
- Explore research partnership opportunities with local universities 
- Assign a senior executive to be responsible for overseeing implementation. 
- Identify attorneys who have an interest and ability to use data, and prepare them to serve as data ambassadors. 

## 3. Data Assessment

- Identify all internal and external data sources. 
- Assess data elements readily available from your case management system, human resources, victim advocate, other criminal justice agencies or specialized task forces. 
- Evaluate which PPIs can be measured using your current data.
