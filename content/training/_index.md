Our team is developing various tools to train prosecutors of all levels, and especially mid-level managers, in using the PPIs on a monthly basis to flag positive changes in trends and identify the areas for improvement. 

The training will help prosecutors understand trends, compare recent numbers to baselines and benchmarks, connect trends to specific policies and practices, identify the ways to improve performance, and help the office implement meaningful reforms. 


Training materials will be available in early 2021.
